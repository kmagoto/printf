printf
The functions in the printf() produce output according to a format as described below. The functions printf() and write output to stdout, the standard output stream

C99 and POSIX.1-2001 specify that the results are undefined if a call to printf() would cause copying to take place between objects that overlap (e.g., if the target string array and one of the supplied input arguments refer to the same buffer).

Return value
Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

Tasks
0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life
Write a function that produces output according to a format.

Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
write output to stdout, the standard output stream
format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
c
s
%
1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't
Handle the following conversion specifiers:

d
i
2. Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel
Create a man page for your function.
